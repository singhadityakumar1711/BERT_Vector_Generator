than 1 month of using this phone, we experienced texting issues - essentially texts wouldn't send & we'd get a failure message.

We did & the phone worked well for about 1 week. We are now back to texting issues & unable to receive/make phone call issues where we have to power down the phone, wait & power it up again.However, upon looking at the message boards on the T Mobile website, I learned that other people have this same issue & T Mobile has acknowledged the issue, but has not resolved it.<<This is a known issue with this device.

First, I'd look to uninstall any texting applications that were used during the failures, and if the texts aren't very long, it might help to not allow the phone to switch between 2G/3G networks. This can be done like this; 1. From the Home screen, press the Menu key. 2. Tap Settings. 3. Tap Wireless and Networks. 4. Tap Mobile Networks. 5. Tap Network mode. 6. Tap GSM Only. While it isn't ideal to keep your phone on GSM only (as browsing speeds will be slower and you will need to manually change the network back to get faster data speeds) we have found that short texts on GSM only rarely fail. I hope this temporary workaround finds you well, and know that we will continue to work on this.T-ForcePersonally, I think that patience can only last so long. Apparently, T Mobile has known about this issue since November but has done nothing to fix it nor have they offered a replacement phone to unsatisfied buyers.We really liked this phone, but it is simply unusable if it doesn't allow a user to text.

This phone, once unlocked, is easily rooted [...] and once you remove the T-mobile bloatware, you'll find more than enough space for all of your apps. You can even tether without incurring extra fees.Unlocking is a bit of a pain. Keep your receipt handy and you will have to fax it, yes FAX to T-mobile along with your IMEI. Alternatively pay $20-$40 to have it unlocked.
